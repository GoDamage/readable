# Readable

Project Two as part of the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

Readable is a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Building the project

Dependencies can be installed using either npm or yarn. Get started by running `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Starting the Server

In a seperate terminal window, cd to `api-server`. Inside this directory, install dependencies via `npm install` or `yarn install`. Start the server using the command `node server`.

## Running the Readable App

The Readable app can be built and run using `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will kick off a server, then the app will be viewable on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
